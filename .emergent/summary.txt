The AI engineer's work primarily involved feature implementation and extensive refactoring. Initial development focused on core AI image generation with a FastAPI/MongoDB backend and Expo React Native frontend. Key features like curated prompts, image preview/save, and a modern UI (including a detailed gallery and horizontal prompt scroll with haptics) were added. Recent efforts included implementing dark mode with a toggle, addressing a persistent reference image removal bug, and a major refactor to integrate Stripe for Upgrade to Pro. The latest significant task is migrating to a Supabase backend for authentication and storage, which introduced a blank screen issue due to server-side rendering conflicts and unapplied database schema. The prompt display issue, showing only two cards, also remains partially unresolved despite backend fixes. The immediate next step is to restart the frontend with updated Supabase credentials.

<product_requirements>
The application is a React Native mobile app for AI image generation using the NanoBanana API. The goal is a SaaS product featuring a freemium model (100 free generations, no signup, paid options pending). Key features include: Supabase-based authentication and image storage, Stripe for payments (all three were suspended, then resumed). Users can upload/take a photo as a reference image and select from curated prompts displayed in a horizontal, snap-to-center scrollable list with haptic feedback. Post-generation, users can preview and save images. The UI is modern and minimalistic, utilizing custom StyleSheet, with most sections integrated into the background, except for the Free Tier card. Navigation is tab-based (Generate, Gallery, Profile), and the Gallery provides an iPhone Photos-style 3x3 grid with a full-screen viewer, swipe navigation, and zoom. Dark Mode support has been implemented with a toggle in the Profile screen. The All category for prompts should list all available styles, and the Free Tier card needs proper horizontal spacing.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully resolve and verify the close button and swipe navigation in the full-screen image viewer within the gallery.
- Address the persistent issue where only 2 prompt cards are displayed per category despite the correct count appearing in the title and backend.
- Manually execute the  against the Supabase database via the Supabase dashboard to create the necessary tables.
- Integrate Supabase Storage for generated and reference images.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a significant refactoring effort to migrate the application from a local authentication and free-tier system to a full Supabase integration. This involved updating both frontend (, , ) and backend (, , ) to utilize Supabase for authentication and potentially future data storage.

A major challenge encountered was a blank screen on the frontend after the Supabase refactor. Debugging revealed two primary causes:
1.  The Supabase client configuration in  was attempting to access the  object during server-side rendering, leading to a . This was addressed by modifying the  file to handle server-side rendering contexts.
2.  The Supabase database schema (defined in ) had not yet been applied to the actual Supabase project, meaning no tables existed. A Python script () was created but failed, leading to the provision of manual SQL instructions () for the user.
3.  Connectivity issues to the Expo tunnel () were also noted, hindering mobile testing, though web functionality was confirmed.

The AI engineer also updated the frontend and backend  files with the actual Supabase URL and API key provided by the user. The  component in  was refactored to use a new  powered by Supabase, replacing the old  and  hooks. The current state is that the Supabase credentials have been updated, and the engineer is about to restart the frontend to test the effect of these changes and the previous  error fix.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend with the updated Supabase credentials and verify if the blank screen issue is resolved.
