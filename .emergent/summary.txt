The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development of a React Native image generation app, leveraging Expo and FastAPI. Initially, a FastAPI/MongoDB backend with NanoBanana (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) integration was established, using an . Core frontend components for image generation, upload, and gallery were set up. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested a Supabase backend. The AI engineer explored a hybrid Supabase approach (for DB, auth, storage, Stripe payments), leading to substantial frontend and backend architectural changes. However, after implementing the freemium flow and reference image selection, and debugging numerous TypeScript errors, it was discovered that actual image generation was still using mock data. Consequently, the backend was reverted to the original pure FastAPI + NanoBanana integration, discarding the Supabase hybrid in favor of getting the core AI generation working. The current state focuses on validating this core functionality.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to build a React Native mobile application for image generation using the NanoBanana API, with pre-defined prompts and image upload capabilities. This evolved into a SaaS product requirement, including:
- **Freemium Model**: 5 free image generations per user, then paid options (.99/month for unlimited, or /bin/bash.50 per image).
- **Authentication**: Required for usage tracking and payments (initially login-first, then shifted to try before signup).
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe integration for managing payments.
- **Image Storage**: Images to be saved in Supabase Storage (though backend later reverted from Supabase).
- **Reference Image**: Ability for users to upload or take a photo to use as a reference for AI image generation.
- **Technology Stack**: React Native (Expo) frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database initially, with a brief exploration of a hybrid Supabase approach (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) before reverting the backend to pure FastAPI. AI integration via NanoBanana (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) and  with an .
The implemented features include the UI for a freemium onboarding flow, image upload/capture for reference images, and a connection (now being re-established) to the NanoBanana API.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the actual image generation API call from the frontend correctly connects to the NanoBanana backend and processes images.
- Re-evaluate and implement the full SaaS features (Supabase for auth/storage, Stripe for payments, freemium logic) as the backend was reverted from the hybrid Supabase approach.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer identified that the frontend was using mock images from  instead of connecting to the real NanoBanana AI API. In response, the engineer reverted the backend from the previously attempted hybrid Supabase setup back to a simpler FastAPI application solely focused on NanoBanana image generation. This involved completely rewriting  to ensure a clean, working integration with the  library and the . The backend service has been restarted and confirmed to be healthy, reporting as ai-image-generator version 1.0.0. The next immediate step is to test the actual image generation API to confirm that the backend is now correctly processing image generation requests.
