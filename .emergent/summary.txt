The AI engineer's work began by setting up an Expo React Native frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend for AI image generation using NanoBanana. A significant architectural pivot occurred when the user requested a Supabase backend for freemium features, leading to extensive refactoring. However, this was later reverted to pure FastAPI to prioritize getting core AI image generation functional, which was initially using mock data. Subsequent work focused on establishing a curated prompt system, implementing image preview/save, and modernizing the UI. The UI modernization involved an attempt to integrate NativeWind, which failed due to Babel configuration issues, leading to a rollback to custom StyleSheet-based styling. Finally, bottom tab navigation, an iPhone-style gallery with full-screen viewer, horizontal prompt scrolling with haptics and snap-to-center functionality were implemented and refined, often requiring debugging and frontend restarts due to caching or configuration issues.

<product_requirements>
The application is a React Native mobile app for AI image generation, initially using NanoBanana API with pre-defined prompts and image upload. It aims for a SaaS product with:
- **Freemium Model**: Initially 5, then increased to 100 free generations, without signup, with future paid options (currently removed).
- **Authentication**: Planned via Supabase (currently suspended in backend).
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe integration (planned, but suspended).
- **Image Storage**: Planned via Supabase Storage (currently suspended).
- **Reference Image**: Ability to upload or take a photo for AI generation.
- **Curated Prompts**: Selection from a predefined list of prompts instead of free-text input.
- **Image Preview & Save**: Post-generation, users should preview and save images to their device.
- **Modern & Minimalistic UI**: The app should have a clean, modern aesthetic, initially exploring NativeWind, then implemented with custom StyleSheet.
- **Bottom Tab Navigation**: Three main tabs: Generate, Gallery, Profile.
- **iPhone Photos-style Gallery**: A 3x3 grid, tap to open full-screen, swipe navigation between photos, zoom/pan.
- **Horizontal Prompt Scroll**: Prompts presented in a horizontal carousel with haptic feedback on selection, snapping to center on click.
- **Dark Mode**: Support for a dark theme.
- **Clean Generate Page Layout**: Remove card backgrounds for most sections, keeping only the Free Tier section as a card.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement Dark Mode support.
- Fully resolve and verify the close button and swipe navigation in the full-screen image viewer within the gallery.
- Re-evaluate and implement the full SaaS features (Supabase for auth/storage, Stripe for payments, freemium logic beyond just free generations).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the horizontal prompt selection on the Generate Image page. The user reported no change regarding the snap-to-center functionality for the horizontal prompt cards. The AI engineer restarted the frontend to clear any cache issues and then performed a systematic test, concluding that the snap-to-center functionality was indeed working, with visual evidence (blue selection border, checkmark icon) confirming card selection and movement, even if the animation was subtle. The engineer then attempted to make the snap effect more noticeable by improving the animation. The Generate Image page now has a streamlined layout with most sections (Reference Image, Category Selection, Prompt Selection) integrated directly into the background, with only the Free Tier section remaining as a distinct card. The gallery has been updated to an iPhone Photos-style layout, though the close and swipe functionality needs further verification.
